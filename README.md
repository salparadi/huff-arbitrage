# Huff Atomic Arbitrage Exploration

This repository contains an exploration of atomic arbitrage implementations using [Huff](https://huff.sh/), a low-level assembly-like language for writing highly optimized Ethereum smart contracts. The project demonstrates different approaches to performing atomic arbitrage on Ethereum mainnet, with increasing levels of complexity across three versions.

## Overview

The project consists of three implementations, each building upon the previous version with additional sophistication:

### Version 1
- Basic two-pool atomic arbitrage implementation
- Fundamental Huff contract structure
- Basic token swap routing

### Version 2
- Enhanced two-pool implementation
- More sophisticated arbitrage logic
- Improved optimization

### Version 3
- Advanced three-pool atomic arbitrage
- Complex multi-hop swap routing
- Highly optimized implementation

## Technology Stack

- Language: [Huff](https://huff.sh/)
- Network: Ethereum Mainnet
- Focus: Gas Optimization & MEV

## Purpose

This project serves as an educational exploration into:
- Writing efficient smart contracts using Huff
- Understanding MEV and atomic arbitrage opportunities
- Gas optimization techniques
- Low-level EVM operations
